# The Grug Brained Developer: 2025 Edition

*A layman's guide to surviving the AI apocalypse while still not knowing what doing*

---

**Note:** This is an unofficial 2025 update inspired by the original [The Grug Brained Developer](https://grugbrain.dev/) by the original grug brain developer. All credit for the format, voice, and foundational wisdom goes to the original work. This is just grug trying to apply same thinking to new complexity demons of 2025.

---

## Introduction

grug brain developer still not so smart, but now grug compete with robots that can write code faster than grug can think

grug very confused by new world but still program many year and learn some new things, mostly that everything still broken just in new ways

this update for 2025 because complexity demon spirit now have AI army and grug need new club

## The New Eternal Enemy: AI Complexity

apex predator of grug now complexity demon with AI sidekick

AI make complexity worse in sneaky way: now everyone think they can build anything because "AI will help" but AI just make more complex faster

grug see many project where human say "let AI generate microservice architecture" and now have 47 services that do nothing but talk to each other about talking to each other

AI like giving loaded club to baby grug: dangerous for everyone

complexity demon spirit very happy with AI because now can create abstractions faster than any grug can understand

grug rule: if AI generate code and grug not understand, grug not ship

## The Prompt Engineering Trap

new type of big brain developer emerge: "prompt engineer"

prompt engineer think they big brain because can ask AI to write code

but grug notice: prompt engineer often not know if AI code actually work or just look impressive

prompt engineer say things like "I optimized the prompt to generate better factory patterns" and grug slowly reach for club

grug learn: AI code need same review as human code, maybe more

AI not understand business logic, AI just pattern match on training data

grug prefer: use AI for boring stuff (write getter/setter, basic CRUD), keep grug brain for important stuff (actual business logic, architecture decisions)

## TypeScript Everywhere

in 2025, everything must be TypeScript apparently

front end TypeScript, back end TypeScript, build tools TypeScript, even database migrations TypeScript somehow

grug remember when JavaScript was simple and could debug in browser

now grug need compile TypeScript to JavaScript to run in browser that already run JavaScript

grug very confused but admit: when hit dot, get nice list of things can do, so type system still good for grug brain

but grug warning: many developer now think types solve all problems

types not save you from logic bugs or complexity demon, types just help with autocomplete

## Kubernetes Everywhere

every company now think need Kubernetes even if just serve static website

grug see startup with 3 users deploy on 15-node Kubernetes cluster because "cloud native best practices"

complexity demon spirit absolutely delighted

grug rule: if can't explain why need Kubernetes to 5-year-old, probably don't need Kubernetes

Docker good, Kubernetes probably too much for most grug

## The Framework Churn Continues

React still popular but now have Next.js, Remix, Gatsby, and 47 other frameworks on top

Vue now have Nuxt, Vite, and probably 12 more by time grug finish writing this

Angular... grug not even know what happening with Angular anymore, probably still exist somewhere

grug tired of learning new framework every 6 months

grug recommend: pick boring stack, get good at it, ignore shiny new thing unless actually solve real problem

## The AI Code Review Problem

many team now use AI for code review

AI say things like "consider using dependency injection pattern here" for simple 5-line function

AI not understand context or business requirements, just match patterns from training data

grug prefer: human review for logic and business sense, AI review for syntax and basic mistakes

also grug notice: junior developer rely too much on AI review, not learn to review code themselves

## Cloud Complexity

everything must be "cloud native" now

simple CRUD app now need:
- API Gateway
- Lambda functions
- Message queues  
- Event buses
- Service mesh
- Observability platform
- 12 different monitoring tools

grug remember when put PHP file on shared hosting and it work fine

grug not against cloud, but cloud make very easy to build very complex system very quickly

complexity demon spirit love cloud because infinite ways to connect things badly

## The Observability Industrial Complex

everyone now talk about "observability" instead of just logging and monitoring

need distributed tracing, metrics, logs, alerts, dashboards, synthetic monitoring, chaos engineering, and probably 15 other things grug not understand

grug just want know when thing broken and why

observability vendors very happy to sell grug 47 different tools that all do similar thing but integrate poorly

grug recommend: good logging still solve 80% of problems, start there

## Testing in 2025

unit tests now run by AI

integration tests run in Kubernetes

end-to-end tests run in cloud with synthetic data

test pyramid now test galaxy

grug still prefer: write code, write test that check if code work, done

but now need test for AI-generated code, test for infrastructure, test for security, test for performance, test for accessibility, test for carbon footprint probably

testing complexity demon spirit very powerful now

## The Return of Monoliths

big brain developer finally admit maybe microservices not always good idea

now everyone talk about "modular monoliths" and "service-oriented architecture" 

grug think: this just fancy way to say "maybe don't split everything into tiny pieces"

grug always prefer: start with monolith, split when actually have good reason

but now must call it "modular monolith" to sound smart

## Remote Work and Async Everything

everyone work from home now, which good for grug work-life balance

but now everything must be async: async programming, async communication, async decision making

callback hell evolve into async/await hell

grug brain hurt from all the promises and streams and reactive programming

grug just want simple: function take input, return output, maybe write to database

## Conclusion 2025

world more complex than ever, but grug still survive

grug learn: AI useful tool but not magic, complexity demon spirit still main enemy, simple solution usually better

most important grug wisdom for 2025: resist urge to use every new shiny thing, focus on solving actual business problems

grug say again: complexity very, very bad, even with AI helping

you say now: complexity very, very bad, even with AI helping

is still true in 2025, maybe more true

end of day, still just grug trying to make computer do useful thing for other grugs

complexity demon spirit may have AI army now, but grug have experience and club

club still work pretty good
